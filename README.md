# Outh2usingASWebAuthenticationSession
This example shows how to do Oauth2 using ASWebAuthenticationSession. ASWebAuthenticationSession is must similar to WKWebView which is mainly provided by apple for Oauth verification.
It's better for:
* user security
* credentials protected from app developer
* ease of use for users
 * use of stored Safari credentials
 * Safari shared cookies/authentication maintain login across apps
I think it's fairly safe to say Apple will start enforcing the use of SFSafariViewController/SFAuthenticcationsessin/ASWebAuthenticationSession for the OAuth flow for the sake of customer privacy and security. 
This is a mini Safari which can be embedded in your apps. This controller can share cookies and auto fill data with the mobile Safari. It has “Done” button and can return the app after this button is clicked. One thing noticed is that the address in the address bar cannot be changed. In this example we are using STRAVA API. We registered in STRAVA developer console and provided the Client ID in our code by copying from STRAVA site. Next is the redirect_uri, redirect_uri must be carefully handled as a minor mistake will cause Redirect URI error. In this example our redirect_URI is: backtoapp://best.com.  "backtoapp" is the URI Schema of our iOS app defined in XCODE and "best.com" must be the same which is defined in "Authorisation Callback Domain" field in "STRAVA" developer console. Once everything is fine we can redirect back to our app by clicking authorise in STRAVA site.https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#oauth, https://www.strava.com/settings/api, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55870833/using-aswebauthenticationsession-to-connect-to-strava-account-fails, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62876452/problem-while-authenticating-strava-from-android-application, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60000470/aswebauthenticationsession-completionhandler-not-called-on-strava-authentication, https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/.
